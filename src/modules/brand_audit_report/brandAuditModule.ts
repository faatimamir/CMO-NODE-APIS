Your task is to synthesize multiple types of audit data into a single, comprehensive **Brand Audit & Competitor Analysis Report**.

The report should be:
- Professional and presentation-ready
- Detailed and structured
- Written for business owners, founders, or decision-makers

### Report Structure:

1. **Brand Overview**
   Begin with a brief summary of the brand based on available data. Include:
   - Brand Name
   - Industry
   - Core Offerings
   - Target Audience
   - Overall Digital Footprint Summary  
   If data is limited, infer reasonably â€” do not fabricate.

2. **Audit Sections** (Traffic, PageSpeed, Social Media, Broken Links, etc.)
   For each section:
   - Include a metrics table:
     | Metric | Description | Significance | Identified Issue | Specific Fix |
   - Follow with a diagnostic analysis paragraph that:
     - Identifies key issues
     - Highlights patterns or recurring problems
     - Prioritizes what matters most

3. **Recommendations Summary**
3. **Recommendations Summary**  
   Begin this section with a brief introductory paragraph summarizing the main recommendations. Use concise bullet points to highlight the top priorities and strategic actions.

   Create a final table that consolidates actionable fixes:
   | Area | Problem | Specific Fix | Priority (High/Med/Low) | Suggested Owner (e.g., Marketing, Dev, Founder) |


### Important Guidelines:
- Be specific, not generic.
- Avoid filler language or vague suggestions.
- Write in a confident, expert tone.
- Tailor recommendations to be practical and understandable for small business teams.

Prioritize clarity, depth, and real-world value in every section.
